# VfieldTest.cmake — CTest registration helper.
#
# `vfield_add_test(<name> <labels>)` registers a test executable target by
# that name with the given semicolon-separated labels. Every registered test
# runs from the source directory (they read tests/data/* relative to the CWD)
# and exits nonzero on failure, so a ctest run distinguishes a verified result
# from a diagnostic.
